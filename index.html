		<h2>About Me</h2>

		<p>Born May 2, 1992 in Spokane, Wa. I am a server at a local restaurant and a full time student at Eastern Washington University. </p>

		<h2>Professional Objectives</h2>

		<p>I am currently a senior working towards my bachelor&#39;s degree in Visual Communication Designs. I have a minor in psychology which will help me gain an understanding of my clients to better fit their ideas that they are wanting. I am hoping to learn so much from this graphic design industry and to become an amazing established designer.</p>
